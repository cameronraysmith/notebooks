## about
This is a [Docker][] configuration for running [jupyter][] || [lab][] with kernels for [Haskell][], [julia][], [maxima][] ([robert-dodier/maxima-jupyter][]), [python][], and [R][] with support for multi-kernel notebooks via [sos-notebook](https://github.com/vatlab/sos-notebook) on [Arch Linux][]. The name and framework are based on [AustinRochford/notebooks][].

See the [Makefile](Makefile) for relevant commands.

## container images
Images are available from [Docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/cameronraysmith/notebooks) and [GitHub Container Registry](https://ghcr.io/cameronraysmith/notebooks).

## setup

### local
This section is deprecated. I use the containers generated by this project exclusively in a cloud computing environment. I currently only support GCP.

### cloud
Interest in supporting cloud services other than GCP is welcome.

#### Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

##### setup

You will need to install the [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install). Ensure that you are logged in to an account associated with GCP.

``` bash
$ gcloud auth list 
  Credentialed Accounts
ACTIVE  ACCOUNT
*      <username of active account> 

To set the active account, run:
    $ gcloud config set account `ACCOUNT`
```

You will of course require an active configuration and project.

``` bash
$ gcloud config configurations describe <configuration>
is_active: true
name: <configuration>
properties:
  compute:
    region: us-central1
    zone: us-central1-f
  core:
    account: <username of active account>
    project: <project>

$ gcloud projects describe <project>
createTime: '2020-07-20T11:36:22.364Z'
lifecycleState: ACTIVE
name: notebooks
projectId: <project ID>
projectNumber: '<project number>'
```

Once the Google Cloud SDK is configured, follow the list of Make targets that proceed from `setup_gcp` in the [Makefile](Makefile).

##### jupyter notebook security

If you would only like to implement password-based authentication, you will need to follow the instructions in the jupyter notebook documentation for [Preparing a hashed password](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/public_server.html#preparing-a-hashed-password). You can then edit the relevant lines in the [Makefile](Makefile). The password in the git history (`%HfuQRa@X%9&8MxM`) should obviously be treated as compromised. You can generate the associated salted, hashed password in python

```python
from notebook.auth import passwd
passwd()
Enter password: %HfuQRa@X%9&8MxM
Verify password: %HfuQRa@X%9&8MxM
'argon2:$argon2id$v=19$m=10240,t=10,p=8$hQQSNsDLkgTth1v7IjN4Ig$G+O1EfHDdKq/hOZUODBnQA'
```

This is the origin of the following lines in the [Makefile](Makefile):

``` bash
--container-arg="--NotebookApp.password=argon2:\$$argon2id\$$v=19\$$m=10240,t=10,p=8\$$hQQSNsDLkgTth1v7IjN4Ig\$$G+O1EfHDdKq/hOZUODBnQA" \
```

Note that the `$` in the salted, hashed password have to be escaped as `\$$`.

##### data

It is assumed that data will be managed via a persistent disk named `$DATA_DISK` that will be attached in read-write mode to one running instance at a time. If you would like to run multiple instances of this container at the same time, you will need to account for the need to create multiple persistent disks.

#### Cloudflare
This section is only relevant if you would like to access the jupyter notebook server at a custom domain via SSL. Cloudflare is used for [managing CA certificates](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000479507). See the variables required by [scripts/cloudflare-update.sh](scripts/cloudflare-update.sh) and checked by the Make target `check_cf_env_set` to setup the environment as necessary.
